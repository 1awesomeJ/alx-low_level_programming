We started working with Dynamic memory allocation using the malloc and free functions in C.
this is a step up from the automatic memory allocation that the compiler has been doing for us up to now.
It's not as though we're moving away from auto allocation, I'm not sure that'd be possible. We're just adding the capability of allocating memory dynamically to our codes
